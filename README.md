# Lode

A lispy abstraction over the ODE physics engine. It doesnt seek to expose every possible behaviour of ODE but instead to make something that is easy to use and REPL friendly.

Uses the raw-bindings-ode package under the hood, so if this abstraction doesnt work for you please dive in and build on top of raw-bindings-ode too!

## Note

Right now this is just a playground as I learn ODE but it'll be useful eventually.
