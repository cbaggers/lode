# Lode

A lispy abstraction over the ODE physics engine.

Uses the raw-bindings-ode package under the hood, so if this abstraction doesnt work for you please dive in and build on top of raw-bindings-ode too!

## Note

Right now this is just a playground as I learn ODE but it'll be useful eventually.
